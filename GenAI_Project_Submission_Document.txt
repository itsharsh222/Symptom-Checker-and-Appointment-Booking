# Symptom Checker & Appointment Scheduler - GenAI Project Submission

## Student Information
**Project Title:** Symptom Checker & Appointment Scheduler
**Technology Stack:** React (Frontend), Flask (Backend), MySQL (Database), Google Gemini API
**GenAI Tool Used:** Amazon Q Developer
**Development Approach:** Full-stack web application with AI integration

## Project Overview
I developed a comprehensive healthcare web application that allows patients to input symptoms, receive AI-powered medical suggestions using Google's Gemini API, and book appointments with healthcare providers. The application demonstrates practical implementation of GenAI in healthcare technology.

## Prompts Used During Development

### 1. Initial Project Creation Prompt
```
"I need to create a Symptom Checker & Appointment Scheduler project. Patients should be able to input symptoms, get AI-based suggestions, and book appointments. I want to use React for frontend, Flask for backend, and MySQL for database. I have all prerequisites installed. Please create the complete project structure and guide me through the implementation."
```

### 2. Backend Development Prompts
```
"Create a Flask backend application with the following requirements:
- SQLAlchemy models for Patient and Appointment entities
- Integration with Google Gemini API for symptom analysis
- RESTful API endpoints for symptom analysis, patient management, and appointment booking
- Proper error handling and CORS configuration
- Environment variable setup for API keys and database credentials"
```

### 3. Frontend Development Prompts
```
"Develop a React TypeScript frontend with these specifications:
- Component-based architecture with routing
- SymptomChecker component for symptom input and AI analysis display
- AppointmentBooking component for patient registration and scheduling
- Modern, responsive CSS styling
- Form validation and error handling
- Integration with backend APIs using Axios"
```

### 4. Database Design Prompts
```
"Design a MySQL database schema for the healthcare application:
- Patient table with contact information and unique constraints
- Appointment table with foreign key relationships
- Proper indexing for performance optimization
- Sample data for testing
- Database setup scripts for easy deployment"
```

### 5. AI Integration Prompts
```
"Implement Google Gemini API integration for medical symptom analysis:
- Configure API authentication and error handling
- Create structured prompts for symptom analysis
- Format AI responses for user-friendly display
- Include medical disclaimers and safety warnings
- Handle API rate limits and failures gracefully"
```

### 6. Troubleshooting Prompts
```
"Help me resolve the following issues:
- MySQL connection authentication problems
- React application startup errors due to folder naming
- Gemini API key configuration and testing
- Node.js dependency conflicts and path resolution
- CORS issues between frontend and backend"
```

- **Result:** Patients receive detailed AI-generated medical insights with appropriate disclaimers

### 2. Patient Management System
- **Prompt Used:** "Develop a patient registration system with duplicate prevention, data validation, and secure storage."
- **Implementation:** Created SQLAlchemy models with unique email constraints and form validation
- **Result:** Efficient patient data management with error handling

### 3. Appointment Scheduling
- **Prompt Used:** "Build an appointment booking system with date/time selection, patient association, and status tracking."
- **Implementation:** Developed booking forms with validation and database integration
- **Result:** Complete appointment management functionality

### 4. Responsive User Interface
- **Prompt Used:** "Design a modern, mobile-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and professional healthcare styling."
- **Implementation:** Created responsive CSS with clean design principles
- **Result:** User-friendly interface accessible across all devices
